# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

							#This should be overwritten
PROJECT_NAME           = "mppadl"
# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

							#This should be overwritten
PROJECT_BRIEF          = "API for Kalray mppadl Library"


# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = include mppadl.dox


# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.
# In Doxyfile you can use ENV (and not make) variable (O is the output dir when using kalray makefile)
